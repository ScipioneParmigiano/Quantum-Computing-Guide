## Resources

[Quantum computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/overview/understanding-quantum-computing) is the use of principles in quantum mechanics such as [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) and [entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) to process information. Quantum computing will play a big role in the innovation of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

[Qubits (quantum bits)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/concepts/the-qubit) are the fundamental object of information in quantum computing.
